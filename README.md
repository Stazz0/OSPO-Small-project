# OSPO-Small-project : Streamlining Scientific Reproducibility: Integrating RO-Crates with Chameleon for COMPSs Experiments

Simplify your research workflow management with these helpful tools:

1. RO-Crate Analyzer:  A Python script designed to extract essential metadata from RO-Crates (Research Object Crates) focusing on software dependencies and operating system requirements.
2. Software Dependency Image Generator: Streamlines containerization with this tool. Input your software dependencies and it automatically generates a basic Dockerfile ready for customization.
3. Prototype Chameleon Communication:  Explore the Chameleon Cloud API through this script.  Begin your interaction with simple actions like listing available images and lay the groundwork for more advanced API usage.
